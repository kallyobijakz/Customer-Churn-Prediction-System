## Overview
ConnectTel, a leading telecom company, is facing a critical challenge with customer churn, threatening its long-term sustainability and growth. The company's current retention strategies are insufficient in preventing the loss of valuable customers to competitors. To address this issue, ConnectTel is developing a Customer Churn Prediction System that leverages advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to accurately forecast customer churn.

By identifying at-risk customers early, ConnectTel can implement targeted retention strategies, reduce churn rates, enhance customer loyalty, and maintain a competitive edge in the dynamic telecommunications industry.

## Key Objectives
1. Accurately Predict Customer Churn
Build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of customers leaving the company.
Use customer data (e.g., usage patterns, billing information, customer service interactions) to identify at-risk customers.
2. Improve Retention Strategies
Develop actionable insights based on the model’s output, enabling ConnectTel to create effective retention strategies.
Enable the company to target specific customer segments with tailored offers, promotions, and services.
3. Reduce Customer Attrition and Enhance Loyalty
Implement a proactive approach that minimizes customer churn and maximizes customer satisfaction.
Foster long-term customer relationships and improve overall loyalty.
Machine Learning Models
For this project, multiple supervised learning models were trained and evaluated to predict customer churn. These models include:

Logistic Regression: A simple yet effective algorithm for binary classification problems, used to model the probability of churn.
Decision Tree: A model that provides intuitive decision-making rules to classify customers as likely to churn or not.
Random Forest: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and reduce overfitting.
These models were compared to identify the most effective algorithm for predicting churn in the telecom industry.

## Features
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing data, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.
Model Training: Train Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models on historical customer data to forecast churn.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC to determine the best approach.
Churn Prediction: Predict the probability of a customer churning, enabling ConnectTel to take preventive actions.
Targeted Retention: Provide insights for crafting personalized retention initiatives aimed at at-risk customers.


Load customer data (including demographic, usage, and billing details) into the model for churn prediction.
Model Training:
Train the model using the historical dataset to predict the probability of churn for each customer.
Churn Prediction:
Run the model to generate churn probabilities and classify customers as at-risk or not.
Targeted Actions:


## Model Evaluation
Accuracy: Measure the percentage of correct predictions made by the model.
Precision and Recall: Evaluate the model’s ability to correctly identify churners and minimize false positives.
AUC-ROC: Analyze the model's capacity to distinguish between churners and non-churners, with a focus on true positive rates.
